THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS.

MINIMAL FUNCTIONALITY

It's very minimalistic right now, 
you can chat with people on the server by just typing into the command prompt
You can read the chat from all players that talk.

INSTALLING

Just drop the 3 files from the zip archive into your Hellion Dedicated Server directory

     HellionServerExtender.exe

     NLog.dll

To start the server, just run HellionServerExtender.exe ( make sure the HellionServerExtender.exe.config file exists)



commands start with /

     /players - returns the amount of players on the server
     /help - will have help soon
